## [Binomial success probabilities](https://github.com/gabriellegall/Python_Portfolio/blob/main/Binomial-success-probabilities/binomial-success-probabilities.py)
**Context** : one of my favorite board games is called [7 Wonders Duel](https://board-games-galore.fandom.com/wiki/7_Wonders:_Duel). It's a card based strategy game which involves some risk taking and gambling at the most decisive points. In those scenarios, some critical cards ('desired hidden cards') can get revealed among all the cards present on the board ('hidden cards'). The code I design calculates the probability of obtaining one of those critical cards among all hidden cards if we get to play 1,2,3 times in a row. 

**Script** : it calculates the probabilities of a sucess across a binomial tree with 1,2 and 3 branches for all scenarios of 'desired hidden cards' and 'hidden cards'.

## [Central Limit Theorem](https://github.com/gabriellegall/Python_Portfolio/blob/main/Central-limit-theorem/central_limit_theorem.py)

**Context** :

**Script** : it shows the sampling distribution of 1000 averages for different sample sizes. The script also contains results of a normality test (Jarqueâ€“Bera test) for each of those distributions.
